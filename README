then parse the response returned from the server and
prints out the CNAME and A documents.

$> make

dnsq [-t <time>] [-r <retries>] [-p <port>] @<svr> <name>

timeout (Optional): 
		Indicates in seconds, how long to wait
		before regenerating an unanswered query.
		Default value: 5.

retries (Optional):
		The number of times the client will
		re-generate the query, before it quits 
		with an error, if no response is received
		from the server.
		Default value: 3.

		value: 53.
